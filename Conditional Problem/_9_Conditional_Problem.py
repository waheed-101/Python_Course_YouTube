# Leap Year Checker
# Problem: Determine if a year is a leap year. (Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).


year = 2027

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    leap_year = f"{year} is a leap year"
else:
    leap_year = f"{year} is NOT a leap year"

print(leap_year)
